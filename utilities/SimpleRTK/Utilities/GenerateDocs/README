This directory contains scripts used to process and generate documentation for SimpleRTK.

Overview:
Much of the SimpleRTK documentation that is in the form of doxygen strings and
API language docs is derived from RTK's Doxygen. The process starts
when Doxygen is run on RTK and it produces the RTK Doxygen in XML
format. This can either be generated locally or the nightly can be
automatically downloaded. Next the JSONDocUpdate.sh script can be run
to extract the strings from the ITK XML Doxygen and update the
SimpleRTK JSON filter descriptions. When SimpleRTK is built the JSON
is used as source for the C++ code. Then when SimpleRTK's Documentation
target is made, the SimpleRTK Doxygen in XML will be generated. Lastly
the SwigDocUpdate.sh script can be run to convert the SimpleRTK
Doxygen XML into Swig .i files so that when SimpleRTK is built, inline
documenation for some wrapped languages will be available.

Important end use scripts (see script files for more details:
        JSONDocUpdate.sh - Copies ITK Doxygen into SimpleRTK JSON
        SwigDocUpdate.sh - Copies SimpleRTK Doxygen into Swig .i files

Configuration:
        The config_vars.sh file needs to be manually modified for the system and build configuration.

These scripts are manually run to modify and create files in the source tree with the derived documentation.
